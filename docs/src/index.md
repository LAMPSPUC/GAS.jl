# GAS.jl Documentation

GAS.jl is a Julia package for modeling, forecasting and simulating time series with or generalized autoregressive score models (GAS) models, also known as dynamic conditional score models (DCS). Implementations are based on the paper [Generalized Autoregressive Models with Applications](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jae.1279) by D. Creal, S. J. Koopman and A. Lucas.
