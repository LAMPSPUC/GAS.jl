# ScoreDrivenModels.jl

ScoreDrivenModels.jl is a Julia package for modeling, forecasting and simulating time series with score-driven models, also known as dynamic conditional score models (DCS) or generalized autoregressive score models (GAS). Implementations are based on the paper [Generalized Autoregressive Models with Applications](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jae.1279) by D. Creal, S. J. Koopman and A. Lucas.
